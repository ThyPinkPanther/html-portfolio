<h1>The Best Movies According to Bolu</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>V For Vendetta</h3>
<p>First time I ever saw the main character die in a movie</p>

<h3>Ma Ma Mia</h3>
<p>The entire trilogy is by far the best musical. The Music! The Dancing!! The Fun!!!</p>

<h3>Murder On Orient Express</h3>
<p>This has one of the best detective work on TV; I mean Sherlock Holmes has a run for his money and title of "Best Detective Ever" in Hercule Poirot. Then, you see the plot twist?!!</p>
